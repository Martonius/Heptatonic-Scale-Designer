# Scale-Designer (Formally *Heptatonic)
Working in SuperCollider, on some code for an app that will potentially make it much easier to nail down Diatonic scales I'm hearing in songs that I appreciate which use unconventional tunings/temperaments. There is plenty of chaff, and plenty left that I want to accomplish with this general idea. At least 1 "Quark", KeyPlayer, must be installed.

I have already added some functionality in an update which brings the original two files together.
I have also scaled the functioinality, so it's no longer just for a Heptatonic(7-tone) scale as we're all familiar with, but could be fewer or more tones in a scale.
I just need to add the updated file  which brings it all together.

Anyone who is interested, feel free to add to this idea. 
I also plan to upload this code to the SuperCollider code base at https://sccode.org/
... specifically at https://sccode.org/marty-carlton
